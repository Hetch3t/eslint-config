# ðŸª· serenity

## Motivation

Every time starting new project I was catching frustration due to ESLint / Prettier / Standard etc. setup. So decided to have a single source of truth for linting and formatting purposes for my fullstack JS / TS projects.

## Features

- Very opinionated (though can be overriden)
- Tabs by default
- Focus on readability and consistent code style
- Easy setup for new projects
- Support for both JS and TS

## Installation

### Package dependencies

To get this config working it is required to have installed several packages:

- `eslint: >=8`
- `prettier: >=2`
- `prettier-eslint: >=14`

To install of these with single lint:

```sh
npx install-peerdeps --dev @hetchet/serenity
```

Even if you use `yarn`, this utility will detect that and use `yarn` instead of `npm`.

### Config inheritance

`.prettierrc.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
	...require('@hetchet/serenity/prettier')
	// Any Prettier overrides go here
}
```

`.eslintrc.js`:

```ts
module.exports = {
	...require('@hetchet/serenity/ts')
	// Any ESLint overrides go here
}
```

### Overrides

Indent is handled by Prettier, so if you prefer spaces instead of tabs, then the only thing you will need to change is in `.prettierrc.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
	...require('@hetchet/serenity/prettier'),
	useTabs: false
}
```

## VSCode
For the best experience in VSCode code editor, I can recommend installing these two extensions:
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - to show linting errors
- [Prettier-ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint) - to format code based on Prettier and ESLint settings. Be aware that `>=5.0.0` version is required, which currently is _Pre-Release_.
